# GitHub Repository Setup

Your project is ready to be pushed to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `eduplan`
   - Description: "A comprehensive homeschool planning application with calendar, activities, and child management"
   - Choose: **Private** or **Public** (your choice)
   - DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Push your local code to GitHub:**
   After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

   ```bash
   # Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/eduplan.git
   
   # Push your code
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI

If you want to use GitHub CLI, first authenticate:

```bash
# Re-authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Then create the repository
gh repo create eduplan --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## After Pushing to GitHub

1. **Verify your files are uploaded:**
   - Check that all files are visible on GitHub
   - Confirm that `.env` file is NOT uploaded (it should be ignored)

2. **Ready for Vercel Deployment:**
   - Your repository is now ready to be imported into Vercel
   - Go to https://vercel.com/new
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Add environment variables during setup

## Important Security Notes

✅ Your `.env` file is properly excluded from Git
✅ The `.env.example` file shows what variables are needed without exposing values
✅ Your Supabase credentials will be safely stored in Vercel's environment variables

## Repository Structure
```
eduplan/
├── apps/web/          # React frontend application
├── supabase/          # Database schema
├── DEPLOYMENT.md      # Deployment instructions
├── CLAUDE.md          # AI assistant instructions
└── vercel.json        # Vercel configuration
```

## Next Steps
1. Push to GitHub using the commands above
2. Deploy to Vercel following DEPLOYMENT.md
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
